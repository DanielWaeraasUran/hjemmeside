<div class="kyrie">
<p>I will kill. I will let live. I will harm and I will heal.
    <br> None shall escape my grasp. None shall escape my sight.
    <br> Be crushed.
    <br> I welcome those who have grown old and those who have lost.
    <br> Devote yourself to me, learn from me, and obey me. 
    <br> Rest.
    <br> Do not forget song, do not forget prayer, and do not forget me. 
    <br> I am light and relieve you of all your burdens.”
    <br> Do not pretend.
    <br> Retribution for forgiveness, betrayal for trust, despair for hope, darkness for light, dark death for the living.”
    <br> Relief is in my hands. 
    <br> I will add oil to your sins and leave a mark.
    <br> Eternal life is given through death.
    <br> Ask for forgiveness here.
    <br> I, the incarnation, will swear.
